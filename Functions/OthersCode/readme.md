## readme: OthersCode

We gratefully utilize several other code packages that are available online. 

Each intact copy of the original download (including the license if provided) is kept in this directory. 
In cases where we use (slightly) customized versions of the original code, 
the customized code is saved separately with a `_custom` tag in the file name.
